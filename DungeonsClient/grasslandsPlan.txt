Balance items and drop rates
Create boss, triffid

Ent will walk slowly towards the player.
When it gets in range 10 or something, it spawns leaflings with no loot.

  - The player deals w the leaflings

The ent shoots BIG leaves that aren't that damaging but apply SLOW
The ent continues advancing slowly towards the player. Trigger range is very low, however, so it will return to spawn.


Ent phase 2: 
	Moves faster towards closest players, spawning damaging tiles in a 2 thick square around it


Tiles should be updated after

Damaging tiles:
	Code should run in the tile's object.
	So in update()

Entities have an OnScreen var
If they're not on screen, just tp directly to their front most location
And dont call update (?)

To defeat solo:
	Player enters ent room and lures the leaflings out
	Returns to the room and tanks the ent's hits

To defeat in a group:
	Someone lures all leaflings out the room
	The others attack the ent
