Grasslands

Comments:
	Should be more difficult than desert, but not by an immense amount.
	Muncher needs rename
	A special that does what the ent's special does? That would be SICK but totally overpowered. Save it for a later boss.

Implemented Items:
Head:
	Elven helmet, vine helmet  :  Overtakes desert totally
Torso:
	Plant armour, cobweb armour  :  Scorpion scale form desert still a GOOD candidate
Weapons:
	Spider fang dagger, Elven bow [useless?], elven sword [useless?], earth staff
		: Cactus blade still the best short distance
		Though spider fang is useful in cramped spaces
		Earth staff overtakes fire staff as best ranged though.
Accessory:
	Speed charm, corrupt amulet
	: Cursed cactus eye probably the best
Specials:

Best balanced set would probably be
Vine helmet, Plant armour, Cactus sword / Earth staff, Cursed cactus eye

Should give us a good special.
Not just a heal.
Grassy healy heal tho
