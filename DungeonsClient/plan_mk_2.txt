Plan

I think so:
Changes:
  Deprecate BIOME TYPE and the word BIOME in general
  Replace with
    DungeonType + DungeonTypeData
    OverworldType + OverworldTypeData
  
  Classes inheriting from GameState:
    DungeonGS
    OverworldGS
    TownGS
  

Town:
  Main, safe overworld area
  Chest in the middle, and a place you can change skins.
  On the town's outskirts are passages to overworld areas.

Overworld:
  Each has a floor colour in TOWN indicating the type of the world.
  The world looks like the normal Overworld. Make it smaller, and way less dungeons.
  No splits too, and curvier roads.

  An overworld's type has the following info associated
   - Floor tile spawnlist [e.g. grass1 90% grass2 10%] for the CENTER only
      (and tl tile spawnlist)
   - Dungeon spawnlist [e.g. water dungeon 50% shark boss 10%]
    (However we keep rerolling the spawnlist til we get at least 3 distinct dung)
   - A boss EntitySpecies
   - An ObstacleType, for the obstacle spawned in Town

Dungeon:
  Each dungeon has to be defeated. This can be handled by BossSpawner.
    Once defeated, it notifies the Overworld object, which sends a message to everyone.

I dont know
 One currency or two (normal + premium) ?
