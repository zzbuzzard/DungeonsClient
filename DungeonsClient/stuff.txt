Implementation issues:
	ITEM DISAPPEAR SYSTEM BAD
	Can't see your life when an enemy is beneath you
	Boss room should *fully* reset after death - so scorpions should die.

Idea issues:
	It was boring after a while. 
		More items?
		More rare spawns? Rare rooms and structures? 
		Overworld events?
		Or, balance to be less hard [I have done] and then maybe they can move on to grass
	Same items again and again - but no point of getting an item twice
		Merging items - Would be a huge commitment but could be cool. Level an item up like feeding pets in rotmg
		Selling items - Much less rewarding but better than dropping excess

Just some ideas:
	Level caps on areas.
		You can't enter the grass area til you hit level 10.
		But we don't want to make it super linear:
		You should unlock multiple places at level 10
		Then another 2 at level 25, kinda thing. Thats probably it though, 5 base biomes.
		Could have a super rare one for level 35+ or something but thats mean
