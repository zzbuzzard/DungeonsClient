Total base stat bonus points should amass to around the best gear in total.
Best gear will have around +25 to various stats, at most +30.
Base stats should max out, and you should only be able to max 3 and a bit.

Lets say you get 1 stat point per level.
Can apply 30/30/30/10

You get 1 stat point from 1..10
You get 0.5 otherwise
You get 1 stat points from 90..100

1 stat point every level.
But also premium currency rewards every few levels.

Rewards :
 Level 1..9 = 1 stat point
 Level 10 = 2 stat points, 5 gems, level 10 skin
 Level 15 = 0 stat points, 5 gems
 Legel 20 = 2 stat points, level 20 skin
 Level 25 = 0 stat points, 10 gems
 Level 30 = 2 stat points,
 Level 50 = 5 stat points, 20 gems

Every multiple of 5 gives you some gems.
Every ..5 gives you gems and no stat points.
Every ..0 gives you gems and 2 stat points, or 5 points at 50, or 5 points at 90, or 5 points at 100.
